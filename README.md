# Hello!

I’m [Chris Krycho][home]—a follower of Christ, a husband, and a dad. I’m a software engineer by trade; a theologian by vocation; and a writer, runner, podcaster, and occasional composer by hobby. I also cohost and produce [<cite>Winning Slowly</cite>][ws], a podcast about technology, religion, ethics and art; and occasionally write for [<cite>Mere Orthodoxy</cite>][mere-o].

[ws]: https://winningslowly.org
[mere-o]: https://mereorthodoxy.com

Things I’m currently working on and/or passionate about include:

- top-notch [TypeScript][ts] support for [Ember][ember]
- theological anthropology
- the intersection of Christian ethics and emerging technologies

You can sometimes find me [on Twitter][twitter] or [LinkedIn][li]—only [sometimes][schedule]!—but I’m always happiest to receive [email](mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com)!
