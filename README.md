# Hello!

I’m [Chris Krycho][home]—a follower of Christ, a husband, and a dad. I’m a software engineer by trade; a theologian by vocation; and a writer, runner, and composer by hobby.

[home]: https://v5.chriskrycho.com

I recently conttibuted new materials and a major revision to [_The Rust Programming Language_ book][book], including a new chapter on async programming in Rust and updates for the Rust 2024 Edition. Over the past half decade, I delivered top-notch [TypeScript][ts] support for [LinkedIn][li], including a spec for [Semantic Versioning for TypeScript Types][semver], and drove the [Ember][ember] TypeScript roadmap and significant parts of Ember’s framework roadmap.

Previously, I cohosted and produced [_Winning Slowly_][ws], a podcast about technology, religion, ethics and art; and created [_New Rustacean_][nr], a podcast which taught tens of thousands of people [the Rust programming language][rust].

I am passionate about:

- programming languages and frameworks as tools for improving the reliability and usability of software
- theology proper and theological anthropology
- the intersection of Christian ethics and emerging technologies

You can sometimes find me on [Bluesky][bluesky], [LinkedIn][li], and [Mastodon][mastodon]—though only [sometimes][schedule]!—but I’m always happiest to receive [email](mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com). I also occasionally write for [_Mere Orthodoxy_][mere-o].
