# Hello!

I’m [Chris Krycho][home]—a follower of Christ, a husband, and a dad. I’m a software engineer by trade; a theologian by vocation; and a writer, runner, and composer by hobby.

[home]: https://v5.chriskrycho.com
[ws]: https://winningslowly.org
[mere-o]: https://mereorthodoxy.com
[nr]: https://newrustacean.com

Things I’m currently passionate about include:

- programming languages and frameworks as tools for improving the reliability and usability of software
- theology proper and theological anthropology
- the intersection of Christian ethics and emerging technologies

**I am also currently looking for a job that checks off some of those boxes—read more in [Next: Role?](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/next/role/)—so feel free to [get in touch](mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com)!**

Over the past half decade, I delivered top-notch [TypeScript][ts] support for [LinkedIn][li], including a spec for [Semantic Versioning for TypeScript Types][semver] and drove the [Ember][ember] TypeScript roadmap along with significant parts of Ember’s framework roadmap.

You can sometimes find me on [Bluesky][bluesky], [LinkedIn][li], [Mastodon][mastodon], and [Twitter][twitter]—though only [sometimes][schedule]!—but I’m always happiest to receive [email](mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com)! I also occasionally write for [<cite>Mere Orthodoxy</cite>][mere-o].

Previously, I cohosted and produced [<cite>Winning Slowly</cite>][ws], a podcast about technology, religion, ethics and art; and created [New Rustacean][nr], a podcast which taught tens of thousands of people the Rust programming language.
